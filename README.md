# TDNA_primer_design
Command Line tool to generate genotyping primers for Arabidopsis T-DNA lines

This module essentially duplicates the functionality of the SALK Signal T-DNA primer design tool (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.html)
Running setup.py will download the necessary files including the Arabidopsis genome fasta and T-DNA insertion locations from SALK website.
After the initial file downloads the tool can be run without an internet connection.
